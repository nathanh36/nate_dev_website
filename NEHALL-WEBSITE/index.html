            I am a Master of Science in Biostatistics graduate from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I currently work full-time at Siemens Healthineers as a Biostatistician. In May of 2017, I graduated with a B.S. in Public Health with a concentration
            in Biostatistical Studies and a Minor in Mathematics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Most of my experience revolves around statistical programming and analysis: I am an advanced programmer in R and SAS statistical programming
            languages, with intermediate skills in SQL, Tableau, HTML, CSS, and STATA. I am highly skilled at developing interactive R Shiny web applications and tools, as well as polished R Markdown reports. Statistical methodology, clinical trials,
            data science, data visualization, and machine learning are also my areas of expertise.
